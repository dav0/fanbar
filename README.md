sports fan oriented applications

The idea is to work together to create applications which can be freely used and which in turn
use freely available images and resources which are not hampered by copyright restrictions.

Most sports teams are owned with all rights reserved, so the idea is to explore and develop new types
of sporting events which are more open in nature and capable of sharing artistic media.

Initial technologies will initially include Java & Spring Roo for a back end Rest server application,
with hopes of adding an Angular.js based front end Rest client.  Other technologies will be considered as well.

The IDE used to create the initial code base is Spring Tool Suite (STS) version 3.5, but since this is an
Open Source project, the full version of Jetbrains IntelliJ IDEA should also be an option.
